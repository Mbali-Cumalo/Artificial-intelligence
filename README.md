What is AI?
AI is all about building systems that can think, learn, and make decisions like humans.

There are 3 main types:

Narrow AI: Focused on one task (like chatbots, recommendation systems).

General AI: Can perform any intellectual task that a human can do (still a dream).

Super AI: Smarter than humans (future stuff, still theoretical).

I saw examples in self-driving cars, fraud detection, virtual assistants, etc.

Quick AI History Recap
Started with rule-based systems (symbolic AI).

Then came Machine Learning ‚Üí models that learn from data.

Deep Learning brought huge improvements (e.g., speech recognition, image classification).

AI winters = periods when hype dropped and funding stopped.

Search Algorithms
AI can solve problems by searching through possibilities.

Uninformed Search: Doesn‚Äôt know where goal is. Examples:

BFS (Breadth-First Search)

DFS (Depth-First Search)

Informed Search: Uses heuristics.

A* = best combo of cost-so-far + estimated cost to goal

Greedy = chooses what looks best next

Game AI: Learned about Minimax for decision-making and Alpha-Beta Pruning to make it faster.

Knowledge Representation
AI needs a way to represent facts and rules.

Propositional and First-Order Logic: ways to express statements and reason about them.

Also touched on knowledge graphs and ontologies (used in things like Google Search).

Inference = drawing new conclusions from known info.

Machine Learning Basics
This part was üî•

Supervised Learning: We give input + correct output (e.g., email spam detection).

Unsupervised Learning: Only input, model finds patterns (e.g., customer segmentation).

Reinforcement Learning: Agent interacts with environment, learns from rewards (like training a game AI).

Neural Networks & Deep Learning
Neural networks = layers of "neurons" mimicking the brain.

Feedforward NN: basic structure.

CNNs (Convolutional Neural Nets) ‚Üí great for images.

RNNs (Recurrent Neural Nets) ‚Üí great for sequences (e.g., text, time-series).

Only intro level, but really interesting stuff.

NLP (Natural Language Processing)
How machines understand and generate human language.

Learned about:

Text cleaning & tokenization

Word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec)

Sentiment analysis

Basic idea of transformers and language models

Computer Vision
How machines ‚Äúsee‚Äù and understand images.

Covered:

Image classification (e.g., cat vs. dog)

Object detection

Use cases in medical imaging, security, etc.

Robotics (Brief Overview)
Sensors ‚Üí perception (understanding surroundings)

Actuators ‚Üí movement

Discussed localization, mapping, and planning

AI helps robots navigate, avoid obstacles, etc.

AI Ethics
Super important topic.

Risks of biased models ‚Äî if training data is biased, AI will be too.

Concerns around:

Privacy (especially with surveillance systems)

Accountability (who's to blame if AI messes up?)

Transparency (can we explain AI decisions?)

Learned about the need for responsible AI.

Tools Used (Light intro)
Mostly Python

Some examples in:

Jupyter Notebooks

Scikit-learn

(Optional mentions of TensorFlow/Keras)

My Key Takeaways
AI is everywhere and it‚Äôs evolving fast.

It‚Äôs not just about coding ‚Äî understanding logic, ethics, and data is equally important.

This course gave me a solid foundation, and I‚Äôm excited to dive deeper into ML, NLP, and AI applications in real projects.
